# Hi there, I'm Mistero 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **self-taught programming enthusiast** with a passion for learning and exploring various programming languages. Although programming isn't my profession, it’s one of my favorite hobbies. Here's a bit more about me and my projects:

## 🔍 What I’m learning

I love diving into different languages and technologies to broaden my skill set. My favorite languages so far include:

- **Java** ☕️
- **Python** 🐍
- **Golang** 🚀
- **C++** 💻

Lately, I've been focused on expanding my knowledge in **network programming** and **web development** 🌐.

## ⚙️ What I'm working on

Currently, I’m developing a P2P file transfer and backup system called **Linkwave** 🔗🌊. It's my way of experimenting with concepts like:

- **Data encryption & security** 🔒
- **MongoDB for managing databases** 🗄️
- **SFTP for secure file transfers** 📂

The goal is to take what I’ve been learning and apply it to something practical.

## 🌱 Always Growing

Although I’m not a professional developer, I’m always eager to learn and grow. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out! 🤝
